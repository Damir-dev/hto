Hide Text Overflow

Hide Text Overflow my own algorythm developed on JavaScript. This algorythm can break line if it bigger than container, then adds an ellipsis (it's depends which parameters you send in Hide Text Overflow function call), plus it can calculate lines and then show only such number of lines (depends what you send in funcion call), then show only this lines on page. Works everywhere where you can run JavaScript libs. HTML5 and earlier version of HTML. Any web browsers.

Hide Text Overflow includes Load DOM To Array function. This function get object then load object and all his childrens to array.
